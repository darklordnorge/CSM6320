\section{Uncertainty}\index{Uncertainty}
A purely logical approach may not work very well for statements which include multiple uncertain factors(e.g. Road accident on your way to the airport? Road work? Flooding? Nazi Zombies?\\
A purely logical approach would state: "$A_8$ will get me there on time."\\
Considering uncertain factors this would change to:"If there's no accident on the bridge, and it does not rain, and my tires remain intact etc, THEN $A_8$ will get me there on time"\\
