\section{Case Based Reasoning}

\begin{itemize}
\item Case law: made up of, and from, hundred and thousands of precedent cases
\item Principle: cases with similar facts should be treated in similar ways 
\item In cases where the parties disagree on what the law is: looking to past precedential decisions of relevant courts
\item If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past: following the reasoning used in the prior decision
\item If the current dispute is fundamentally distinct from all previous cases: creating new 
\item CBR: analogous to human experts solving a problem through employing their relevant past experience
\begin{itemize}
\item exemplar-based reasoning
\item instance-based reasoning
\item memory-based reasoning
\item case-based reasoning
\item analogy-based reasoning
\end{itemize}
\item if the new problem has some novel aspects, aspects need to be created
\end{itemize}

Domains that CBR Works well:
\begin{itemize}
\item Broad but shallow domain
\begin{itemize}
\item bot a single tree, but a forest of small trees
\item a number of loosely connected problems that must be dealt with
\item need different kinds of expertise
\end{itemize}
\item Experience, rather than theory, is the primary source of knowledge
\begin{itemize}
\item Many past examples of problems that occur
\item rather than having a deep understanding of the domain
\end{itemize}
\item solutions are reusable
\begin{itemize}
\item old solution is useful for a new problem
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Case-Based Reasoning System and 4R Cycle}
\begin{itemize}
\item Input: new problem
\item Output: a solution to the new problem
\item case base
\begin{itemize}
\item store cases(experience)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{4R Cycle}
\begin{itemize}
\item Retrieve: relevant cases, match most similar cases, retrieve solutions from theses cases
\item Reuse: solutions in stored cases
\item Revise: the retrieved solution(s) to reflect differences between new case and retrieved case(s)
\item Retain: new cases into database
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Observations define a new problem
\item not all features may be known
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{New Problem vs Old Case}
\begin{itemize}
\item Compare similarity of each feature
\item Similarity by weighted average
\end{itemize}
